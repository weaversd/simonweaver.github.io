I'm a graduate student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) in the [Integrated Biomedical Sciences](https://ibms.nd.edu/) PhD program. I'm a member of the [Whelan Lab](https://whelanlabnd.weebly.com/) in the [Chemistry and Biochemistry Department](https://chemistry.nd.edu/)where we apply analytical chemistry to human health questions, specifically the detection of ovarian cancer. My projects focus on the proteomic characterization of an ovarian cancer biomarker (MUC16), and the optimization of techniques like capillary electrophoresis and fluorescence anisotropy to characterize aptamer (small, functional oligonucleotides) binding to molecular targets.
